OS: windows
to install : install.cmd 
for daily run:   run.cmd (for best practice make shortcut to the startup group)
to customize how time tracker icon looks when playing/on replace resources\TimeTracker\TracyIcon\On | Off with proper snapshots

use config.txt to customize behaviour 

enjoy :)


Note: a collaboration needed to add possbile Tray Icons (for on/off states and also for the monitor itself, just add images to the folder and it will be included automatically considered when checking for time tracker state) and adding more sounds for future modifications
